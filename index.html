        <div>
            The MASterMind product is a powerful drag-and-drop workflow editor that allows users to automate actions based on specific events or conditions. The goal of this project is to replace the existing MASterMind tool, which relies on Microsoft Workflow Foundation, with a new, modern, browser-based version built using Angular 18. This new version will enable users to create and customize workflows for automating critical processes, such as alarm dispatching, leading to improved operational efficiency and reduced training times.

With the new designer, users will have the ability to create custom workflows for various systems, automating actions through a user-friendly interface. These workflows can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different scenarios, providing flexibility and greater control over business operations. The browser-based design will also allow for easier access and broader usability, making it a more accessible and adaptable tool for security companies. Overall, this project aims to deliver a next-generation solution that enhances productivity and simplifies workflow management.
